    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis has successfully implemented a comprehensive hedonic pricing model using real apartment data from Poland with Julia. We have:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3a (2 points)**: ✅ Data Cleaning Complete\n",
    "- Created the `area²` variable for non-linear area effects\n",
    "- Converted all binary variables from text ('yes'/'no') to numeric (1/0) format\n",
    "- Generated area last digit dummy variables (`end_0` through `end_9`) to test for psychological pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3b (4 points)**: ✅ Model Estimation Complete\n",
    "- Implemented standard linear regression with comprehensive feature set using Julia's efficient linear algebra\n",
    "- Applied the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem using partialling-out method\n",
    "- Verified that both methods produce identical coefficients (within machine precision)\n",
    "- Achieved strong model fit with meaningful coefficient estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Part 3c (3 points)**: ✅ Premium Analysis Complete\n",
    "- Trained a model excluding apartments with areas ending in \"0\"\n",
    "- Generated price predictions for all apartments using this restricted model\n",
    "- Calculated and tested the price premium for \"round\" area apartments\n",
    "- Performed statistical significance testing using Julia's HypothesisTests.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Julia-Specific Implementation Highlights:**\n",
    "- **Performance**: Julia's just-in-time compilation provides excellent performance for matrix operations\n",
    "- **Syntax**: Mathematical notation that closely matches theoretical formulations\n",
    "- **Type System**: Strong typing helps catch errors and optimize performance\n",
    "- **Ecosystem**: Rich packages like DataFrames.jl, CSV.jl, StatsBase.jl, and HypothesisTests.jl\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Efficient handling of large datasets without Python's GIL limitations\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Easy integration with other scientific computing ecosystems\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Economic Insights:**\n",
    "The analysis provides evidence about psychological pricing in real estate markets. If a significant premium exists for apartments with areas ending in \"0\", this suggests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Buyer Psychology**: Consumers may perceive round numbers as more desirable or trustworthy\n",
    "2. **Seller Strategy**: Real estate agents may use psychological pricing to maximize sale prices\n",
    "3. **Market Efficiency**: The existence of such premiums indicates potential market inefficiencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methodological Contributions:**\n",
    "- Demonstrated the equivalence of full regression and FWL approaches in Julia\n",
    "- Illustrated efficient handling of categorical variables with dummy encoding\n",
    "- Showed how to test for market anomalies using predictive modeling\n",
    "- Provided a template for hedonic pricing analysis in Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Julia's Advantages for Econometrics:**\n",
    "- **Speed**: Near-C performance for numerical computations\n",
    "- **Expressiveness**: Clean, readable syntax for mathematical operations\n",
    "- **Ecosystem**: Growing collection of specialized econometrics and statistics packages\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Excellent performance characteristics for large datasets\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Strong package management and version control\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of analysis is valuable for:\n",
    "- **Real estate professionals** understanding pricing strategies\n",
    "- **Policymakers** assessing market functioning\n",
    "- **Researchers** studying behavioral economics in housing markets\n",
    "- **Students** learning modern computational econometrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology demonstrated here (hedonic pricing with careful feature engineering and statistical testing) is a standard approach in empirical economics and can be applied to various markets where product characteristics drive pricing. Julia's combination of performance, expressiveness, and growing ecosystem makes it an excellent choice for modern econometric analysis.\n",
