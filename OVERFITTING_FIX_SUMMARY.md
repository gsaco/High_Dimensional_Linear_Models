# Overfitting Analysis Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement

The user was experiencing severe issues with their overfitting analysis code that was producing incorrect and extreme results:

### Original Problematic Results:
```
Features | R² (full) | Adj R² (full) | R² (out-of-sample)
------------------------------------------------------------
       1 |    0.2446 |       0.2438 |            0.3157
       2 |    0.2452 |       0.2437 |            0.3118
       5 |    0.2488 |       0.2451 |            0.3102
      10 |    0.2540 |       0.2465 |            0.3036
      20 |    0.2609 |       0.2458 |            0.3088
      50 |    0.1295 |       0.0836 |            0.2486
     100 |    0.0940 |      -0.0068 |            0.1493
     200 |    0.2714 |       0.0891 |            0.2846
     500 |    0.1639 |      -0.6739 |        -3786.7607
    1000 |    0.2533 |          nan |  -9285771536.7705
```

**Issues with original results:**
- Extreme negative out-of-sample R² values (-3786, -9285771536)
- NaN values appearing for high feature counts  
- R² values not showing expected monotonic increase
- No clear overfitting pattern visible
- Results inconsistent with theoretical expectations

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Incorrect Data Generating Process**: The code was using `y = 2*X + e` instead of the class example `y = exp(4*W) + e`

2. **Missing Python Module**: The `assignment1_complete.py` was trying to import `part2_overfitting.py` which didn't exist, only the notebook version existed

3. **No Intercept in Regression**: Using `fit_intercept=False` which led to poor model estimates

4. **Variable Naming Inconsistency**: Using `X` in some places and `W` in others, not matching the class example convention

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Corrected Data Generation Process
**Before:**
```python
# Wrong data generation
beta_true = 2.0
y = beta_true * X.ravel() + e
```

**After:**
```python  
# Correct class example
y = np.exp(4 * W.ravel()) + e
```

### 2. Created Missing Python Module
- Created `Python/scripts/part2_overfitting.py` with all required functions:
  - `overfitting_analysis()`
  - `create_plots()`
  - `interpret_results()`
  - `main()`

### 3. Fixed Regression Settings
**Before:**
```python
model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False)
```

**After:**
```python
model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True)
```

### 4. Consistent Variable Naming
- Changed all variable names from `X` to `W` to match class example
- Updated function parameters and internal logic accordingly

## Results After Fix

### Corrected Results:
```
Features | R² (full) | Adj R² (full) | R² (out-of-sample)
------------------------------------------------------------
       1 |    0.8019 |       0.8017 |            0.8012
       2 |    0.9773 |       0.9773 |            0.9779
       5 |    0.9949 |       0.9949 |            0.9959
      10 |    0.9950 |       0.9949 |            0.9959
      20 |    0.9950 |       0.9949 |            0.9959
      50 |    0.9950 |       0.9948 |            0.9959
     100 |    0.9950 |       0.9945 |            0.9958
     200 |    0.9951 |       0.9938 |            0.9958
     500 |    0.9951 |       0.9902 |            0.9445
    1000 |    0.9951 |          nan |          -16.3777
```

### Verification of Expected Behavior:

✅ **R² (Full Sample)**: Monotonically increases from 0.8019 to 0.9951 as expected

✅ **Adjusted R²**: Peaks around 5-10 features (~0.9949), then gradually declines due to complexity penalty

✅ **Out-of-Sample R²**: Shows classic overfitting pattern:
   - Peaks around 5 features (0.9959) 
   - Remains stable through moderate complexity
   - Shows severe deterioration at extreme complexity (1000 features: -16.38)

### Optimal Model Complexity:
- **By Adjusted R²**: 10 features (Adj R² = 0.9949)
- **By Out-of-Sample R²**: 5 features (OOS R² = 0.9959)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Generation:
```python
def generate_data(n=1000, seed=42):
    np.random.seed(seed)
    W = np.random.uniform(0, 1, n)
    W.sort()  # Sort as in class example
    W = W.reshape(-1, 1)
    e = np.random.normal(0, 1, n)
    y = np.exp(4 * W.ravel()) + e  # Class example formula
    return W, y
```

### Polynomial Feature Creation:
```python
def create_polynomial_features(W, n_features):
    n_samples = W.shape[0]
    W_poly = np.zeros((n_samples, n_features))
    for i in range(n_features):
        W_poly[:, i] = W.ravel() ** (i + 1)  # W^1, W^2, W^3, etc.
    return W_poly
```

### Proper Regression Estimation:
```python
model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True)  # Include intercept
model.fit(W_poly, y)
```

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Created**: `Python/scripts/part2_overfitting.py` - Main module with all functions
2. **Updated**: `Python/scripts/part2_overfitting.ipynb` - Corrected notebook version  
3. **Created**: `Python/scripts/part2_overfitting_corrected.ipynb` - Backup of corrected version
4. **Generated**: `Python/output/overfitting_results.csv` - Results with proper values
5. **Generated**: `Python/output/overfitting_plots.png` - Visualization of proper overfitting behavior

## Validation

The corrected implementation successfully demonstrates:

1. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Clear demonstration through the three R² measures
2. **Monotonic R² Increase**: Full sample R² increases as expected with model complexity  
3. **Adjusted R² Peak**: Shows complexity penalty working correctly
4. **Overfitting Pattern**: Out-of-sample R² shows classic inverted U-shape
5. **Extreme Overfitting**: Proper severe deterioration at very high dimensions (1000 features)

The implementation now correctly follows the class example and produces theoretically sound results that demonstrate overfitting behavior as expected in machine learning theory.
