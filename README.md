# High Dimensional Linear Models - Assignment Implementation

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of Assignment 1 for the High Dimensional Linear Models course, delivered in **three programming languages** with enhanced formatting, interpretations, and cross-language compatibility.

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

The assignment consists of three main parts:
1. **Math (3 points)**: Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL) Theorem proof and verification
2. **Overfitting (8 points)**: Simulation study analyzing overfitting with increasing model complexity  
3. **Real Data (9 points)**: Hedonic pricing model for Polish apartment data

**Total: 20 points**

## 📈 Key Findings Summary

### 🔍 **Part 2: Overfitting Analysis**
- **In-Sample R²**: Monotonically increases with features (misleading for model selection)
- **Adjusted R²**: Peaks early then declines due to complexity penalty
- **Out-of-Sample R²**: Shows classic overfitting pattern - improvement then deterioration
- **Optimal Complexity**: ~2-5 features provide best generalization

### 🏠 **Part 3: Hedonic Pricing**
- **Price Premium Detected**: ~6,437 PLN (7.57%) for apartments with areas ending in 0
- **Statistical Significance**: Highly significant (p < 0.001)
- **Economic Interpretation**: Evidence of psychological pricing in real estate
- **Market Implications**: Suggests behavioral factors influence property valuations
