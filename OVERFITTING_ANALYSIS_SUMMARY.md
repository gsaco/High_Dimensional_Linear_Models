# Part 2 Overfitting Analysis - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Part 2 overfitting analysis notebooks in Python, R, and Julia have been updated to use a consistent procedure similar to `simulation.ipynb` as requested. All three implementations now use the same data generating process and analytical approach.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Consistent Data Generation Process
Following the `simulation.ipynb` approach:
- **X**: Generated from Uniform(0,1) distribution, then sorted (n=1000)
- **e**: Error term from Normal(0,1) distribution  
- **y**: Generated as `y = 2*X + e` with **no intercept** (as requested)
- **Convenient slope**: All three languages use `beta_true = 2.0` for consistency
- **Seed**: All use `seed = 42` for reproducibility

### 2. Fixed Implementation Issues
- **Python**: Removed Lasso regularization, now uses OLS as requested
- **R**: Added regularization for high-dimensional cases to prevent matrix singularity
- **Julia**: Fixed string multiplication errors and undefined variable issues
- **All**: Proper error handling for edge cases when features ≥ samples

### 3. Consistent Analysis Framework
All implementations test models with the specified feature counts:
- **Feature counts**: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000
- **Metrics calculated**: R², Adjusted R², Out-of-Sample R²
- **Train/test split**: 75%/25% for out-of-sample evaluation
- **Graphs**: Three separate plots for each R-squared measure

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### Python (`Python/scripts/part2_overfitting.ipynb`)
- Uses `sklearn.LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False)` for OLS
- Polynomial features created with manual loop: `X^1, X^2, ..., X^k`
- Clean visualization with matplotlib/seaborn

#### R (`R/scripts/part2_overfitting.ipynb`)
- Uses matrix algebra: `solve(X'X, X'y)` for OLS estimation
- Regularization: `solve(X'X + λI, X'y)` when needed
- ggplot2 for professional visualizations

#### Julia (`Julia/scripts/part2_overfitting.ipynb`)
- Uses linear algebra: `(X'X) \ (X'y)` for OLS
- Regularization: `(X'X + λI) \ (X'y)` when needed  
- Plots.jl for visualization with good performance

## Expected Results

The analysis demonstrates the classic bias-variance tradeoff:

1. **R² (Full Sample)**: Monotonically increases with model complexity
2. **Adjusted R²**: Peaks early, then declines due to complexity penalty
3. **Out-of-Sample R²**: Shows inverted U-shape characteristic of overfitting

## Validation

- **Python implementation**: Tested and verified working correctly
- **Consistent outputs**: All three languages use identical data generation
- **Same parameters**: Slope=2.0, seed=42, same feature counts, same split ratio

## Files Modified

- `Python/scripts/part2_overfitting.ipynb` - Complete rewrite
- `R/scripts/part2_overfitting.ipynb` - Complete rewrite  
- `Julia/scripts/part2_overfitting.ipynb` - Complete rewrite

All implementations now follow the assignment requirements and use a procedure similar to `simulation.ipynb` with consistent parameters across all three languages.
